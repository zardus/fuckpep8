# FuckPEP8

This plugin is intended to make life feasible for those of us who are right in the head, and use the proper tools (tabs) for indentation. It uses the awesome detectindent plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1171) to detect how many spaces the poor misguided souls that originally wrote a given Python file use, replace them with tabs, and switch it back before saving.

Pull requests to undo other annoying pep8 insanity are welcome :-)

Special thanks to Luca Invernizzi for the initial prototype of this concept!

## Usage

First, install detectindent and configure some reasonable defaults.

Then, install fuckpep8.

That's it!
